 * Data structure used as the node in the Huffman tree built by
 * HuffmanEncoder and read from the binary file by HuffmanDecoder.
 * The Huffman tree in this application avoids the usual practice of using
 * pointers to link parent nodes to children, in order to facilitate
 * serialization in the binary file.  Instead, the nodes use indices
 * to refer to themselves and their children, which index into a vector
 * of TreeNode addresses held in the HuffmanEncoder and HuffmanDecoder objects.
 * This way, the actual TreeNode addresses can vary, yet the tree can be 
 * reconstructed out of the data written to file.
